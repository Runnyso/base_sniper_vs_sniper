# Base — Sniper vs Sniper Arena

This isn't about tokens.  
This is about **killers**.

When 3 or more of the deadliest sniper bots on Base  
—all with sub-2-second execution—  
start buying the **same** token at the same time…

…it’s not a launch.

…it’s a **bloodbath**.

## Run

```bash
python base_sniper_vs_sniper.py
